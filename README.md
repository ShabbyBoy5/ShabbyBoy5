<h1 align="center">Hey, I'm Rishab 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">I work with GenAI, Deep Learning, and model reasoning — both improving it and challenging it.</h3>

---

### 🧠 What I Do
I build intelligent systems with a focus on **Generative AI, Deep Learning**. I prefer my models non black boxified but LLMs are a pain 😿

---

### 📍 Currently
🚧 Developing **causal counterfactual explanations for time-series anomalies** using SCM-backed diffusion models  
🧾 building cool a clause based contract analysis engine  
⚙️ Exploring Explainability for LLMs

---

### Stuff i've built/currently building
| Project | What it’s about |
|---------|-----------------|
| 🏗️ **Neural Architecture Search (DDQN)** | Built a NAS framework using Deep Double Q-Networks to let an agent explore optimal model architectures |
| ♠ **Texas Hold’em Probability Engine (R)** | Designed a win probability estimator based on evolving hole and community card states |
| 🧠 **Brain Tumor MRI Classifier** | Created a CNN-based system to classify tumor types from axial, sagittal, and coronal MRI views |
| 📜 **Legal Contract Evaluation using GenAI** | Built a Gemini-powered contract analysis engine using vector-based retrieval to detect risky clauses, summarize obligations, and flag compliance gaps through semantic chunking and contextual reasoning |

⭐️ Would love to hear your thoughts on how AI's could be made explainable ,or if u want to be spammed with cat photos.
