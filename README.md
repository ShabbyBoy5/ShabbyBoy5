<h1 align="center">Hey, I'm Rishab 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">I work with GenAI, Deep Learning, and model reasoning — both improving it and challenging it.</h3>

---

### 🧠 What I Do
I build intelligent systems with a focus on **Generative AI, Reinforcement Learning, and Explainable AI**. I care about models that don’t just output answers, but can reason, justify, and adapt.

---

### 📍 Currently
🚧 Developing **causal counterfactual explanations for time-series anomalies** using SCM-backed diffusion models  
🧾 *I’m building a Gemini-driven system that learns to read legal contracts like a reasoning assistant — breaking them into meaningful chunks, retrieving context through embeddings, and calling out risky clauses or missing terms in natural language.*  
⚙️ Exploring lightweight confidence-aware evaluation layers for GenAI outputs

### 📚 Selected AI & GenAI Projects
| Project | What it’s about |
|---------|-----------------|
| 🏗️ **Neural Architecture Search (DDQN)** | Built a NAS framework using Deep Double Q-Networks to let an agent explore optimal model architectures |
| ♠ **Texas Hold’em Probability Engine (R)** | Designed a win probability estimator based on evolving hole and community card states |
| 🧠 **Brain Tumor MRI Classifier** | Created a CNN-based system to classify tumor types from axial, sagittal, and coronal MRI views |
| 📜 **Legal Contract Evaluation using GenAI** | Built a Gemini-powered contract analysis engine using vector-based retrieval to detect risky clauses, summarize obligations, and flag compliance gaps through semantic chunking and contextual reasoning |

### 💬 A Bit About Me
I enjoy designing AI systems that think structurally — whether they’re searching architectures with Q-learning, detecting anomalies with causal reasoning, or dissecting legal clauses like a digital analyst. I appreciate models that not only perform, but explain.
